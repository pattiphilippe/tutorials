## Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Intent
The intent of the Adapter Pattern is to alter an interface so that it matches one a client is expecting. 

The intent of the Facade Pattern is to provide a simplified interface to a subsystem.


## Facade Pattern
The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
