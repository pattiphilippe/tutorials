## Design Principles
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance

## Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsultes each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently form clients that use it.

## OO Basics
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies

## OO Patterns
- Strategy : defines a  family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
  
## Bullet Points
- Knowing the OO basics does not make you a good OO designer.
- Good OO designs are reusable, extensible, and maintainable.
- Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.
- Patterns are proven object-oriented experience.
- Patterns don't give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. You apply them to your specific application. 
- Patterns aren't *invented*, they are *discovered*.
- Most patterns and principles address issues of *change* in software. 
- Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts. 
- We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.
- Patterns provide a shared language that ccan maximize the value of your communication with other developers.
